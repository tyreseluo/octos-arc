# Build the ARC platform submission bundle out of arc/.
#
# Platform contract: main.py and requirements.txt must sit at the zip root, and
# so must template/ (frontend + backend + README.md + template.yaml) -- the
# platform lays template/ out as the initial workspace and hands it to main.py
# via ARCBENCH_TEMPLATE_DIR. A bundle without a complete template/ was observed
# being rejected as "web template is incomplete" (2026-09-20).
#
# The bundle is staged in a temp dir and zipped from there, never from the
# worktree: what lands in the zip is exactly the explicit copy list below.
# Stale worktree artifacts cannot leak in, and dev files are excluded by
# construction rather than by zip patterns.
#
# Deliberately NOT shipped:
#   * tasks/ -- platform task DATA; the runner hands main.py the requirement.
#   * public-tests/ -- evaluation test copies. Gone from the repo, and never
#     shipped (参赛须知: 不得打包测试): the agent no longer reads tests at
#     runtime at all -- no test-dir probing, no spec mapping, no helpers in
#     prompts; acceptance is a requirement-text build+boot+GET / smoke.
#   * local-only instruments: path_split.py, postmortem.py, scoreboard.py,
#     metrics.py, integration/, action_errors.cjs, page_errors.ts,
#     grade-local.py, run-task-local.py, tests/. They analyse runs on a
#     developer machine and have no job inside the container.
#   * arcbench_agent_runtime/ -- a vendored copy of the `arcbench-runtime` pip
#     package that requirements.txt already declares (verified byte-identical).
#     The platform installs requirements.txt, so shipping it is dead weight
#     that can only drift from the real package.
#
# There is no static pipeline .dot to copy: the pipeline's nodes ARE this task's
# requirement nodes, so main.py emits <data_dir>/pipelines/arc_build.dot per run
# from the requirement tree plus prompts/pipeline-implement.md. The definition
# that ships is that generator + its prompt template + arc-policy.toml.

# 800 with the runtime fetch inlined; the container has no octos of its own and
# ours must come from the release, so the fetch (main.py OCTOS_RELEASE_URL)
# counts against the budget rather than being trimmed away. 1100 since the
# acceptance command bounds its own repairs and steps (verify_node.py) and the
# graph grew a seed node and a regression pass -- still glue, not a loop.
# 1200 once the timeouts, output caps and reasoning controls the profile
# runtime ignores in config.json moved onto the graph and the env (#230).
# 1300 for progressive delivery: verified states reach the output dir during
# the run, so a run killed from outside still ships working code.
# Down again once runtime test reading was removed (no locate_tests, no spec
# mapping/slicing, smoke-only acceptance): the glue should stay well under it.
# 1280: requirement prompts now carry their ancestor FOLDER rules (folder_rules()).
# 1300: verify_node prints a workspace map for the next implement node.
# 1320: a node --check syntax gate before boot.
